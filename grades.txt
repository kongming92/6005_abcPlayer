The team contract and all the reflections were fine.  

You did not have to have the following in your abstract classes:     
    @Override
    public abstract String toString();
    
That is automatically added into all classes.  You can just override it in the other classes.
In your getMusic method in the parser, you should have made it more readable by taking large chunks of code out into other methods, instead of having a huge switch/case chain with a lot of code inside.

Missing a the specs in the ast.  
You were missing unit tests for the everything but the Parser, Lexer, and Sequence Player, and there is no testing strategy written for the parserTest and SequencePlayerTest.

Accidentals should not be a MusicalElement, especially with this in it: 

    /**
     * Accidentals have no length, but must implement this method.
     */
    @Override
    public MusicalLength getLength() {
        return new MusicalLength(0, 1);
    }
